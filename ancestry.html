            <h1>Our history</h1>
            <p>On <strong>July 30, 1854,</strong> the first group of Chinese indentured workers arrived in Jamaica. These were 267 Chinese men from the ship <strong>Epsom</strong> lands who came to work under contract for 3 years on the plantations. Later that year, 205 more Chinese men were brought to the island on the ships <strong>Vampire</strong> and <strong>Theresa Jane</strong>, as survivors of a group of 705 sent to Panama. The majority of these original 475 died from the harsh conditions in Jamaica.</p>
            <p>At the end of their contracts, the Chinese began to leave the plantations. Many of the survivors returned to China. Some migrated to other countries.. Those that remained began to open small grocery shops which laid the foundation for the community which would later flourish.</p>
            <p>Between <strong>1864</strong> and <strong>1873</strong> the second group of 200 Chinese workers arrived from Trinidad and Guyana, following the completion of their contracts in those countries and serious damge to the plantations by hurricanes and insects.</p>
            <p>On <strong>July 12, 1884</strong> the third group (696 persons) to arrive were for the most part, Hakka Chinese from the counties of Dung Guan, Fui Yung, and Bao On in Guangdong Province. From the Distribution Roll of the Estates, most of the labourers were assigned to work in St. Thomas, St. Mary, Portland, St Andrew and Westmoreland, with the majority going to Duckenfield in St. Thomas.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Benevolent Society was founded in <strong>1891</strong> to help newcomers and businessmen, as well as to settle disputes among the members.</p>
